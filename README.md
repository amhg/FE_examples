Fix all display issues by using pipes.
Implement swapping items when the up or down arrow is clicked
Have no up arrow on the first item
Have no down arrow on the last item
Items that are on sale (onSale property set to true) should be indicated using the bg-success class
Set the document title to show the # of items in the watch list
Bonus Challenge - Only show 4 movies and have a "show all" button that disappears after it is clicked.
